# Publish to npm when a GitHub release is created
#
# This workflow uses npm Trusted Publishers (OIDC) for secure, tokenless publishing.
# Provenance attestations are automatically generated.
#
# Setup on npmjs.com:
# 1. Go to https://www.npmjs.com/package/tr200/access (after first publish)
# 2. Scroll to "Trusted Publishers" section
# 3. Click "Add trusted publisher"
# 4. Select "GitHub Actions"
# 5. Enter:
#    - Owner: RealEmmettS
#    - Repository: usgc-machine-report
#    - Workflow: npm-publish.yml
#    - Environment: (leave blank)
#
# Fallback: If trusted publishing isn't configured, uses NPM_TOKEN secret
