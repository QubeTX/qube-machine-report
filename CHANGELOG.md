## [3.0.3] - 2026-02-03

## [3.0.1] - 2026-02-03

### Added
- Legacy version cleanup during installation: `tr300 --install` now automatically removes TR-100 and TR-200 configurations before installing TR-300
- Running `--install` multiple times is now idempotent (removes existing TR-300 config and reinstalls fresh)

### Changed
