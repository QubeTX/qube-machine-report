## 0. Quick orientation for a new session

If you just pulled this repo and want to keep building, read these in order:

1. **`MASTER_PLAN.md`** (this file) — what's shipped, what's pending, where to pick up.
2. **`CLAUDE.md`** § "Development Workflow" — the canonical 7-phase cadence (plan → tasks → implement → docs → verify → commit/push → close out).
3. **`CLAUDE.md`** § "CI" — what `.github/workflows/ci.yml` enforces and how to reproduce it locally.
4. **`TESTING.md`** — the manual cross-platform verification matrix and per-version verification log.
5. **`CHANGELOG.md`** — every shipped change with task-ID cross-references in parens.

The auto-memory at `~/.claude/projects/C--Users-hey-Documents-GitHub-qube-machine-report/memory/` (only valid on the original Windows host) duplicates the workflow notes. Don't recreate it on other machines — `CLAUDE.md` is authoritative.

## 1. Status snapshot

### Shipped (committed + pushed to `origin/master`)

| Tag | Commit | Date | Summary |
|---|---|---|---|
| v3.10.0 | `58812cc` | 2026-04-27 | **Foundation** — elevation tier (`is_elevated`, `--no-elevation-hint`, footer hint, JSON `schema_version` + `elevated` + `elevation_unlocks_more`), comprehensive CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml` with cross-platform fmt/clippy/test/build/speed/audit/dist-plan), Codex plugin config at project scope (`.claude/settings.json`), 7-phase development workflow codified in CLAUDE.md, new `TESTING.md` with manual matrix |
| v3.11.0 | `3a252df` | 2026-04-27 | **Windows accuracy + BitLocker** — registry-based OS detection (Win11 by build ≥ 22000, DisplayVersion + UBR), `IsWow64Process2` arch, `WTSQuerySessionInformation` last-login with `GetTickCount64` boot-time fallback, CPUID leaf 16h + `CallNtPowerInformation` CPU frequency, CPUID leaf `0x40000000` hypervisor brand with VBS disambiguation, BitLocker via `Win32_EncryptableVolume` in `MicrosoftVolumeEncryption` namespace |
| v3.11.1 | `22f2002` | 2026-04-27 | **Rust 1.95 MSRV + auto-rustup self-update + uzers migration** — pin `rust-version = "1.95"` after `__cpuid` reclassified as safe-to-call, drop `unsafe { … }` wrappers; `tr300 --update` runs `rustup update stable` first when the binary was placed via `cargo install` (best-effort, silent if rustup absent); migrate `users` → `uzers` to clear RUSTSEC-2025-0040 / 2023-0040 / 2023-0059 |
| (untagged) | `24fdc60` | 2026-04-27 | RUSTSEC audit fix folded into v3.11.1 (no separate tag needed) |
| (untagged) | `14e0d97` | 2026-04-28 | CI: dropped `macos-13` (Intel macOS) from test+build matrices; rolled into v3.12.0 changelog |
| v3.12.0 | `28bda98` | 2026-04-28 | **Windows accuracy refinements (PR #4b)** — VPN-aware default-route detection via `GetBestInterfaceEx` (the WMI adapter list is reordered so the kernel's preferred-route adapter wins, correct on multi-homed/VPN configs), Fast Startup uptime annotation (`HiberbootEnabled` + WMI `LastBootUpTime` divergence > 1h → `UPTIME` row renders `9d 4h 12m (session: 7h 14m)`), nullable `os.session_uptime_seconds` JSON key, `os::collect()` takes `CollectMode` to gate the Fast Startup WMI cost, `wmi::WMIDateTime` for CIM datetime parsing |
| v3.13.0 | `f34e981` | 2026-04-28 | **Windows polish (PR #5 partial)** — native battery via `GetSystemPowerStatus` with 5-state output model (AC Power / X% Charging / X% Plugged in / X% Discharging / Critical / Low / Unknown — "Plugged in" covers gaming-laptop PSU-undersized AND firmware battery-longevity modes), native socket count via `GetLogicalProcessorInformationEx` (alignment-safe walk via `from_le_bytes`), GPU registry-prefer + `filter_software_gpus()` name filter, PowerShell 7+ detection via `PowerShellCore` registry hive (semver tuple comparison, not string sort), terminal parent-process walk via Toolhelp32 (recognizes Windows Terminal, WezTerm, Alacritty, VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Hyper, Tabby, Ghostty, Kitty, MinTTY, Claude Code, Antigravity); E.6 admin RDP login history and C.13 batched-PowerShell fallback were still open at this tag. C.13 later shipped in v3.14.0; task #58 tracks E.6. |
| v3.13.1 | `086ef0a` | 2026-04-29 | **Release infrastructure fix (task #54)** — adds `rust-toolchain.toml` at repo root pinning `channel = "1.95"` AND `components = ["rustfmt", "clippy"]`. Resolves `release.yml` failures on `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` + `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` + `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` runners that shipped with rustc 1.94.1 (below MSRV 1.95 declared in v3.11.1). The auto-generated cargo-dist v0.31.0 release workflow has no rustup setup step; pinning at the workspace level lets rustup auto-install the right toolchain before cargo runs. The components addition was a fix-forward (`086ef0a` superseded `c2e6a65`) — when rustup honors a rust-toolchain.toml it ignores action-level `components:` fields, so listing rustfmt/clippy in the file is required to keep ci.yml's Format + Clippy jobs working. **All 10 release.yml jobs green; v3.13.1 GitHub Release published with 20 assets** (6 platform binaries + MSI + source tarball + shell/PowerShell installers). First successful Release publication since v3.10.0. |
| v3.14.0 | `54dbae1` | 2026-05-10 | **Cross-platform stability + action syntax** — adds positional actions (`tr300 update/install/uninstall`, inherited by the `report` alias), bounded collector subprocess helpers, conditional model/core-topology/motherboard/BIOS/RAM/ZFS rows, additive nullable JSON keys, macOS/Linux accuracy improvements, Windows batched PowerShell WMI-failure fallback, fixed-width/JSON/markdown hardening, and documentation cleanup that removes unimplemented Windows RDP-history promises. |
| v3.14.1 | `3328a8e` | 2026-05-11 | **Release confidence patch** — no new runtime behavior; bumps package metadata for a patch release after the v3.14.0 CI warning-as-error fix-forward and follow-up release-publication docs were verified green on `master`. |
| v3.14.2 | `a6c3841` | 2026-05-11 | **Crates.io + resilient updater release** — publishes the `tr-300` crate, tracks `Cargo.lock`, adds CI-gated crates.io publishing after default-branch CI, ports self-update to a cargo-first probe-and-retry strategy chain, documents all install paths, and removes unrelated historical implementation files/references. |
| v3.14.3 | `25305d8` | 2026-05-11 | **Canonical crates.io package name** — recreates the crate as lowercase `tr300`, changes the Rust library import path to `tr300`, points self-update at `cargo install tr300 --force`, and keeps `tr-300-installer.*` release aliases for v3.14.2 updater compatibility via a cargo-dist `allow-dirty = ["ci"]` workflow customization. |
| v3.14.4 | `ac3fd34` | 2026-05-14 | **Windows install execution-policy preflight** — `tr300 install` now adjusts the Windows PowerShell `CurrentUser` execution policy to `RemoteSigned` when it's `Restricted`/`Undefined`, so the freshly written `$PROFILE` auto-run actually loads on fresh Windows machines. `AllSigned` is intentionally left alone (user warning, no silent downgrade). Verify-after-set catches GPO overrides and surfaces a `LocalMachine`-scope remediation. Non-fatal: the alias write half always succeeds. Drive-by cleanup: moved `mod powershell_fallback_tests` to the end of `src/collectors/platform/windows.rs` to satisfy `clippy::items_after_test_module` under local Windows clippy. |
| v3.14.5 | _pending_ | 2026-05-14 | **Windows install error advisor + Display-formatted top-level errors** — when `tr300 install`/`uninstall` fails to create the profile directory, read/write the profile, or remove the binary, `fail_install(InstallStep, &Path, io::Error)` now streams a multi-paragraph advisory to stderr explaining the likely cause (OneDrive sync state, Intune/AD/AppLocker/WDAC restriction, antivirus block, sharing violation, storage-full, MAX_PATH overflow) with concrete remediation (path to allowlist, antivirus exclusion, `takeown` example). Dispatch keys: `(InstallStep, ErrorKind, raw_os_error, path-onedrive-vs-redirected-vs-local)`. Companion change: `fn main()` now dispatches into `fn run() -> Result<()>` so errors render via Display (`Error: Platform operation failed: ...`) instead of the Debug format (`Error: Platform { message: "..." }`). Affects every command, not just install. |

**Tag status (as of 2026-05-14):**
- `v3.10.0` (`58812cc`): tagged + pushed; release.yml run failed (different failure mode — historic record only).
- `v3.11.0` (`3a252df`): NOT tagged.
- `v3.11.1` (`22f2002`): NOT tagged.
- `v3.12.0` (`28bda98`): tagged + pushed; release.yml run failed (3/6 targets failed with `error: rustc 1.94.1 is not supported by the following packages: tr-300@3.12.0 requires rustc 1.95`); no GitHub Release artifact published.
- `v3.13.0` (`f34e981`): tagged + pushed; release.yml run failed identically (same rustc 1.94.1 < MSRV 1.95 mismatch on 3/6 targets); no GitHub Release artifact published. Run 25039719372.
- `v3.13.1` (`086ef0a`): tagged + pushed; all 10 release.yml jobs succeeded (6 build-local-artifacts + plan + build-global-artifacts + host + announce); GitHub Release published with the standard 6 binaries + Windows MSI + shell/PowerShell installer one-liners + source tarball. README installer one-liner now functional for the first time since v3.10.0.
- `v3.14.0` (`54dbae1`): tagged + pushed; CI run 25642712712 succeeded across fmt/clippy/test/build/audit/dist-plan/speed gates; release.yml run 25642853066 succeeded across plan + six target artifact builds + global artifacts + host + announce; GitHub Release published with 20 assets.
- `v3.14.1` (`3328a8e`): tagged + pushed; CI run 25645894617 succeeded across fmt/clippy/test/build/audit/dist-plan/speed gates; release.yml run 25645999755 succeeded across plan + six target artifact builds + global artifacts + host + announce; GitHub Release published with 20 assets.
- `v3.14.2` (`a6c3841`): tagged + pushed; CI run 25647466576 succeeded across fmt/clippy/test/build/audit/dist-plan/speed gates; crates-publish run 25647553585 published `tr-300` 3.14.2 to crates.io after rerunning fmt/clippy/tests/package/dry-run; release.yml run 25647597021 succeeded across plan + six target artifact builds + global artifacts + host + announce; GitHub Release published with 20 assets.
- `v3.14.3` (`25305d8`): tagged + pushed; CI run 25648618096 succeeded across fmt/clippy/test/build/audit/dist-plan/speed gates; crates-publish run 25648707510 published `tr300` 3.14.3 to crates.io after rerunning fmt/clippy/tests/package/dry-run; release.yml run 25648740343 succeeded across plan + six target artifact builds + global artifacts + host + announce; GitHub Release published with 22 assets, including canonical `tr300-installer.*` installers and `tr-300-installer.*` compatibility aliases. `tr300` returned 404 from the crates.io API before release, so this version recreated the package under the corrected lowercase package name. The previous `tr-300` package name is treated as a legacy updater-compatibility concern only.
- `v3.14.4` (`ac3fd34`): tagged + pushed; CI run 25848439537 succeeded across all 13 jobs (fmt + clippy + audit + dist-plan + tests on Linux/macOS ARM/Windows + release builds on the same three + auto-run speed gates on all three); crates-publish run 25848562250 published `tr300` 3.14.4 to crates.io from the exact CI-tested SHA; release.yml run 25848716551 succeeded across plan + six target artifact builds + global artifacts + host + announce; GitHub Release published with 22 assets (canonical `tr300-installer.*` + legacy `tr-300-installer.*` aliases + six platform archives + MSI + checksums + source tarball + dist-manifest). Self-update probe (`tr300 update --json`) from a local v3.14.4 binary confirmed `latest_version=3.14.4` and `update_available=false`. crates.io API confirmed `newest_version=3.14.4`. Fixes the original user-reported `UnauthorizedAccess` PSSecurityException on fresh Windows machines after `tr300 install`.

The historical untagged versions (v3.11.0, v3.11.1) are documentation-only; users should install the latest published release, which subsumes them.

### Live behavior changes already on master (as of v3.14.3)

After a fresh `git pull` and `cargo build --release`, you'll see (verified on Windows 11 25H2 build 26200.8246, unelevated user session, Alienware on AC):

- `OS` row: `Windows 11 25H2` (was `Windows 11 (26200)`)
- `KERNEL` row: `26200.8246` (was `26200`)
- `LAST LOGIN` row: real timestamp (was `Login tracking unavailable`)
- `HYPERVISOR` row: `Bare Metal (Hyper-V/VBS)` on Win11 with VBS active (was `Hypervisor Present`)
- `MACHINE IP` / `DNS IP` rows now reflect the kernel's preferred-route adapter (correct on multi-homed/VPN configs — the old WMI-first-match behavior was a coin flip when a tunnel was active)
- `UPTIME` row renders `9d 4h 12m (session: 7h 14m)` annotation when Fast Startup is on AND cold-boot diverges from kernel-session by > 1h (skipped in `--fast` mode)
- `BATTERY` row: 5-state output — `AC Power` (≥95% on AC, no charging — clean, no percentage); `X% (Charging)` (on AC, charging); `X% (Plugged in)` (on AC, < 95%, not charging — gaming-laptop PSU-undersized OR firmware battery-longevity); `X% (Discharging)` (off AC, normal); `X% (Critical)` / `X% (Low)` overrides; `X% (Unknown)` fallback
- `SHELL` row: detects PowerShell 7+ via `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\PowerShellCore\InstalledVersions\<GUID>\SemanticVersion` before falling through to legacy WinPS-5.x; semver-tuple comparison (not string sort) so `7.10` correctly outranks `7.9`
- `TERMINAL` row: env-var pre-checks (`WT_SESSION`, `TERM_PROGRAM=vscode`, `CURSOR_TRACE_ID`/`CURSOR_AGENT`) THEN parent-process walk via Toolhelp32 (cap 10 levels, intermediate hosts skipped) — recognizes Windows Terminal, WezTerm, Alacritty, VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Hyper, Tabby, Ghostty, Kitty, MinTTY, Claude Code, Antigravity
- `GPU` rows: registry-prefer in full mode + `filter_software_gpus()` name filter (strips Microsoft Basic Render Driver, Hyper-V Video, etc.) — only hardware adapters appear
- New footer line below the table on Linux + Windows when unelevated:
  - Linux: `Run with sudo for motherboard, BIOS, and RAM slot details`
  - Windows: `Run as Administrator for BitLocker status`
  - macOS: no footer (no meaningful elevated unlocks)
- `--no-elevation-hint` flag suppresses the footer
- `--fast` mode never shows the footer (auto-run safety)
- JSON output gains `schema_version: 1`, `elevated`, `elevation_unlocks_more`, `session.encryption`, `os.session_uptime_seconds`
- Positional actions now work without double-dash syntax: `tr300 update`, `tr300 install`, and `tr300 uninstall`. Existing `--update`, `--install`, and `--uninstall` remain supported.
- `tr300 update` now uses a cargo-first probe-and-retry strategy chain instead
  of executable-path install detection: `cargo install tr300 --force` when
  `cargo --version` succeeds, then `curl`/`wget` shell installers on Unix or
  `powershell`/`pwsh` installers on Windows. JSON update output preserves
  legacy `"method"` and adds precise `"strategy"` or failed `"attempts"`.
- Users can install from crates.io with `cargo install tr300`; v3.14.3 was
  published by GitHub Actions, and future crate versions publish after
  successful default-branch CI using `.github/workflows/crates-publish.yml`.
- Reports now render optional platform rows only when populated: `MODEL`, `CPU TOPOLOGY`, `MOTHERBOARD`, `BIOS`, `RAM SLOTS`, and `ZFS HEALTH`. Matching JSON keys are additive nullable fields under schema version 1.
- Collector subprocesses use bounded timeouts and degrade missing, hung, or malformed platform data to omitted rows / `null` values instead of blocking report generation.

### Pending (not yet shipped)

- ~~**PR #2** — macOS accuracy~~ — substantially shipped in v3.14.0 for the low-risk, verifiable paths on the current Mac: CPU brand/frequency fallback, Rosetta arch label, scutil hostname/IP, AppleLocale precedence, P/E core split, machine model row, full-mode battery health, and `vm_stat` fallback.
- ~~**PR #3** — Linux accuracy~~ — substantially shipped in v3.14.0 with fixture coverage and CI validation: systemd-resolved DNS priority, aarch64 CPU fallback, locale precedence, power_supply battery iteration + health, `ip route get ... src`, terminal env priority + single `ps` fallback, WSL/container/VM detection, ZFS health, and elevated `dmidecode` rows.
- **PR #5 leftovers (task #58)** — E.6 admin-only RDP login history via Security Event 4624 XML parsing. Deferred because it needs elevated-shell validation on Windows. C.13 batched-PowerShell fallback is shipped in v3.14.0.
- **Cross-platform 3-state battery model** (task #56) — extend the v3.13.0 Windows 5-state model to Linux + macOS. Linux can land independently using `/sys/class/power_supply/AC*/online` + `BAT*/status`; macOS waits on PR #2 hardware.
- ~~**Cargo-dist installer regression** (task #54)~~ — **resolved in v3.13.1.** What looked like a cargo-dist v0.31.0 installer regression on `x86_64-apple-darwin` + `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` (observed on the v3.10.0 release.yml run) actually resolved itself in those runner images at some point between v3.10.0 and v3.12.0. The MSRV bump to 1.95 in v3.11.1 then surfaced a *different* failure on `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` + `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` + `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` runners — those images ship rustc 1.94.1, and `release.yml` (auto-generated by cargo-dist) does not run rustup before invoking `dist build`. Fix: `rust-toolchain.toml` at repo root pinning `channel = "1.95"`. Rustup is pre-installed on every GitHub-hosted runner and respects the pin transparently. v3.10.0 retains its broken release.yml run as historic record; v3.13.1 is the first release with a working artifact since then.
- **PR #6** *(optional, deferred unless explicitly requested)* — `--security` flag adding TPM 2.0 + Secure Boot + FileVault + SELinux/AppArmor rows.

### Recommended next steps (in order)

1. ~~**Watch CI on the v3.13.1 commit, then tag.**~~ Done. CI run 25096685639 green on `086ef0a`; tag `v3.13.1` pushed; release.yml run 25096833278 succeeded across all 10 jobs; GitHub Release published with 20 assets.
2. ~~**Investigate cargo-dist regression** (task #54)~~ — **done in v3.13.1.** The fix turned out to be smaller than the original plan suggested: `rust-toolchain.toml` at repo root with both `channel` and `components`, no cargo-dist version bump, no migration to the astral-sh fork.
3. ~~**Ship v3.14.0**~~ — done. `master` pushed, CI green, tag `v3.14.0` pushed, release.yml green, GitHub Release published.
4. ~~**Ship v3.14.1**~~ — done. `master` pushed, CI green, tag `v3.14.1` pushed, release.yml green, GitHub Release published.
5. ~~**Ship v3.14.2 + crates.io**~~ — done. `master` pushed, CI green, crates.io publish workflow green, tag `v3.14.2` pushed, release.yml green, GitHub Release published.
6. ~~**Ship v3.14.3 canonical `tr300` crate**~~ — done. `master` pushed, CI green, crates.io publish workflow green, tag `v3.14.3` pushed, release.yml green, GitHub Release published with `tr300-installer.*` plus legacy `tr-300-installer.*` aliases.
7. Next functional work: task #58 E.6 admin-only RDP history, only from an elevated Windows validation session.

## 1.5 What's already best-in-class (do not "fix")

Confirmed correct by research and verified in production. Don't waste effort re-investigating these unless a CHANGED upstream invalidates the source.

- **OS pretty name on Linux** — `/etc/os-release` PRETTY_NAME ([os-release(5)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/os-release.5.html))
- **Linux load average** — `/proc/loadavg`
- **Linux uptime** — `/proc/uptime`
- **Linux memory available** — `/proc/meminfo` MemAvailable (kernel 3.14+)
- **Linux disk usage** — sysinfo's statvfs path
- **macOS DNS** — `scutil --dns` (resolv.conf on macOS is decorative — it explicitly says so in its own header)
- **macOS uptime** — `kern.boottime` sysctl (sysinfo uses it)
- **macOS sw_vers** — same data as `kern.osproductversion`
- **Windows hostname** — `GetComputerNameExW` (sysinfo uses it)
- **Windows memory** — `GlobalMemoryStatusEx` (sysinfo uses it)
- **Windows locale** — `GetUserDefaultLocaleName` (already in code)
- **SSH client IP detection** — `SSH_CLIENT` / `SSH_CONNECTION` env vars
- **Cores (physical + logical) on all platforms** — sysinfo handles SMT/HT correctly; Apple Silicon P/E cores need `hw.perflevel*` enrichment (M7) but the basic counts are right.
- **Battery presence/charge** — Linux `/sys/class/power_supply`, macOS `pmset`, Windows WMI `Win32_Battery` (PR #5 C.10 will swap Windows to the faster `GetSystemPowerStatus`).
- **macOS Activity Monitor formula** — `(active + wired + compressed) * page_size` matches sysinfo on most M-series; A.9 only swaps if a divergence is observed.

## 2. Hard constraints (non-negotiable, established by the user)

These shaped every decision and **must** be preserved by future PRs:

1. **Pager rejected.** Don't add a built-in pager / scrollback / `less` wrapper. Modern terminals all have native scrollback; auto-run depends on the prompt being free immediately after the table renders.
2. **`--fast` must stay sub-second.** Current Windows release median: ~308 ms. CI gate: < 1500 ms. New collectors that need subprocesses or > 50 ms must be full-mode-only.
3. **No admin/sudo in the default code path.** Auto-run runs as the user. Admin-only collectors must degrade silently (return `None`, let the elevation footer hint cover the gap). Never panic, prompt, or print errors to stderr.
4. **Report can't grow in line count.** Every PR's integration test must verify line count is unchanged. New rows are only allowed when *conditional* (battery enriched in place; ZFS Health only when zpool exists; ENCRYPTION row only when readable).
5. **Don't "fix" BTRFS subvolume / APFS container disk numbers.** sysinfo's reporting matches what the OS itself shows in Disk Utility / `df`. Changing the aggregation logic would regress against user expectations.

## 3. The full plan (consolidated from `~/.claude/plans/take-a-look-around-elegant-stonebraker.md`)

### Section 1 — macOS accuracy fixes (PR #2)

Research grounded in [Apple Developer Forums #652667](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/652667), [#664774](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/664774), [#671792](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/671792), [eclecticlight sysctl reference](https://eclecticlight.co/sysctl-information/), [eclecticlight Oct 2025 frequency table](https://eclecticlight.co/2025/10/28/updating-cpu-frequencies-for-apple-silicon-macs/), [psutil #1892](https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil/issues/1892), [cpufetch #139](https://github.com/Dr-Noob/cpufetch/issues/139).

| ID | Issue | Current source | Better source | File |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| M1 | CPU frequency = 0 GHz on Apple Silicon | sysinfo (returns 0 — `hw.cpufrequency` doesn't exist on M-series) | Chip-name → max-frequency lookup table keyed on `machdep.cpu.brand_string` | `cpu.rs`, `platform/macos.rs` |
| M2 | CPU brand stale on M3/M4 (older sysinfo) | sysinfo | `sysctl -n machdep.cpu.brand_string` direct | `cpu.rs`, `platform/macos.rs` |
| M3 | Architecture wrong under Rosetta 2 | `std::env::consts::ARCH` | Add `sysctl -n sysctl.proc_translated`; show `Apple Silicon (running x86_64 via Rosetta 2)` | `platform/macos.rs` |
| M4 | Hostname doesn't match System Settings | sysinfo `gethostname()` | `scutil --get ComputerName` | `os.rs`, `platform/macos.rs` |
| M5 | Local IP picks wrong interface on multi-homed/VPN | Hardcoded en0/en1/en2 | `scutil --nwi` for primary interface, then `ipconfig getifaddr` | `network.rs`, `platform/macos.rs` |
| M6 | Locale shows shell `LANG` instead of user's region | `LANG` first | `defaults read -g AppleLocale` first; strip `@rg=...` | `platform/macos.rs` |
| M7 | No P-core / E-core breakdown | sysinfo physical/logical only | `hw.perflevel0.physicalcpu` + `hw.perflevel1.physicalcpu`; render `12 cores (8P + 4E)` | `cpu.rs`, `platform/macos.rs` |
| M8 | Memory "used" doesn't match Activity Monitor | sysinfo's used | `host_statistics64` formula `(active + wired + compressed) * page_size`; only swap if sysinfo diverges | `memory.rs`, `platform/macos.rs` |

**Skip:** thermal pressure level (undocumented + Intel-only), serial number (PII risk), time-since-last-power-off (no API distinct from `kern.boottime`).

| L1 | DNS reads stub `127.0.0.53` on systemd-resolved | `/run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf` → `/run/NetworkManager/resolv.conf` → `/etc/resolv.conf` | `network.rs` |
| L2 | CPU brand empty on aarch64 | `/proc/cpuinfo` model name → `/sys/firmware/devicetree/base/model` → `CPU implementer`/`CPU part` decode | `cpu.rs`, `platform/linux.rs` |
| L3 | Hypervisor misses cloud + containers | Port `systemd-detect-virt` logic in-process: cpuid hypervisor flag → DMI sys_vendor → cgroup/`.dockerenv`/`.containerenv`/container env; covers kvm, qemu, vmware, hyperv, parallels, virtualbox, xen, wsl, docker, podman, lxc, systemd-nspawn, aws, azure, gcp | `platform/linux.rs` |
| L4 | Locale ignores `LC_ALL` and `LC_CTYPE` | POSIX precedence: `LC_ALL` > `LC_CTYPE` > `LANG` > `C` | `platform/linux.rs` |
| L5 | Battery hardcodes `BAT0`/`BAT1` | Iterate `/sys/class/power_supply/*` filtering on `type == "Battery"`; add health % via `energy_full / energy_full_design` | `platform/linux.rs` |
| L6 | Local IP wrong on multi-homed hosts | `ip route get 1.1.1.1` parse "src" field | `platform/linux.rs`, `network.rs` |
| L7 | Terminal detection ordering causes misses | Check `KITTY_WINDOW_ID`, `WEZTERM_PANE`, `GHOSTTY_RESOURCES_DIR`, `ALACRITTY_LOG`, `KONSOLE_VERSION`, `VTE_VERSION`, `FOOT_PID`, `TILIX_ID`, `WT_SESSION` first; `TERM_PROGRAM` second; ps-walk fallback | `platform/linux.rs` |
| L8 | WSL2 not detected | Check `/proc/sys/kernel/osrelease` for `microsoft-standard-WSL2` (folded into B.3) | `platform/linux.rs` |
| L9 | `last`/`lastlog` deprecated on glibc 2.40+ | `lastlog2` → `lastlog` → `last -F -1 -w` | `session.rs` |
| E.3 | Motherboard / BIOS only readable as root | When `is_elevated`: parse `dmidecode -s baseboard-{manufacturer,product-name}`, `bios-{vendor,version,release-date}`, `chassis-type`. Render in natural spots; full-mode + elevated only | `platform/linux.rs` |
| E.4 | RAM slot detail only readable as root | When `is_elevated` + full mode: `dmidecode -t memory`, render compact summary like `2x16GB DDR5-5600 SK Hynix` | `platform/linux.rs` |

**Container/musl caveats:** Alpine has no systemd, no `mokutil`, often no `lspci`. Logic must be in-process. Containers inherit host kernel/uptime/loadavg/memory — flag in JSON as `in_container: true` rather than "correcting".

### Section 3 — Windows accuracy fixes

**PR #4 (already shipped — see commit `3a252df`):** C.1 (registry OS), C.2 (IsWow64Process2 arch), C.3 (WTS last-login), C.6 (CPUID 16h + CallNtPowerInformation freq), C.7 (CPUID 0x40000000 hypervisor + VBS disambiguation), E.5 (BitLocker).

**PR #4b (already shipped — see commit `28bda98` / v3.12.0):**

| ID | Fix | File |
|---|---|---|
| C.4 | DNS+IP via `GetBestInterfaceEx` + `GetAdaptersAddresses` (VPN-aware default-route detection); replaces WMI Win32_NetworkAdapterConfiguration | `platform/windows.rs:88-109` |
| C.5 | Fast Startup uptime annotation: registry `HiberbootEnabled` + `GetTickCount64` vs `LastBootUpTime`; append `(session: Xh)` suffix when divergent | `os.rs`, `platform/windows.rs` |

**PR #5 (Windows polish, mostly shipped across v3.13.0 + v3.14.0):**

| ID | Fix | File |
|---|---|---|
| C.8 | GPU via DXGI `EnumAdapters1` (filter `DXGI_ADAPTER_FLAG_SOFTWARE` and vendor 0x1414 software adapter) | `platform/windows.rs` |
| C.9 | Cores via `GetLogicalProcessorInformationEx(RelationProcessorPackage, …)` | `cpu.rs`, `platform/windows.rs` |
| C.10 | Battery via `GetSystemPowerStatus` + `DeviceIoControl(\\.\Battery0)` for cycle count + design capacity | `platform/windows.rs` |
| C.11 | PowerShell 7+ detection via `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\PowerShellCore\InstalledVersions\*` | `session.rs`, `platform/windows.rs` |
| C.12 | Terminal parent-process walk via `CreateToolhelp32Snapshot` + `Process32NextW` for conhost-only sessions | `platform/windows.rs` |
| C.13 | Batched PowerShell fallback into single JSON call (when WMI/COM init fails) | `platform/windows.rs:88-109` |
| C.14 | Drop COM/WMI init from `--fast` hot path once C.4/C.6/C.9/C.10 land | `platform/windows.rs` |
| E.6 | Admin-only full RDP login history via Security Event Log 4624 (filter `LogonType in [3, 7, 10, 11]`) | `platform/windows.rs` |

**Combined cold-start savings on full mode:** ~150–400 ms by replacing remaining WMI paths with Win32 APIs.

### Section 4 — Cross-platform reliability (mostly done in PR #1)

| ID | Status | Note |
|---|---|---|
| X1 | Done in v3.14.0 | ZFS Health row: when `zpool` is on `$PATH`, run `zpool list -H -o health` and aggregate worst-of. Skip in `--fast`. Render only when zpool exists. |
| X2 | Done in PR #1 | BTRFS/APFS volume-semantics note in CLAUDE.md so contributors don't "fix" what isn't broken. |
| X3 | Done in PR #1 | JSON `schema_version: 1` in every output. |

### Section 5 — Speed improvements

| ID | Optimization | Status | Saves |
|---|---|---|---|
| S1 | Linux: collapse 3 sequential `ps` calls into one `ps -e -o pid,ppid,comm` | Done in v3.14.0 | ~20–30 ms |
| S2 | Windows: replace WMI paths with Win32 APIs, eliminate COM init from hot path | Done for `--fast`; native paths remain primary in full mode | ~150–400 ms cold |
| S3 | Windows: batched PowerShell fallback when WMI fails | Done in v3.14.0 | ~150–250 ms (uncommon path) |
| S4 | macOS: already optimal, no action | N/A | — |

## 3.5 Skipped (researched and explicitly rejected)

These were investigated during the planning research and **deliberately not added**. If a future contributor proposes any of them, point them at this section to short-circuit a re-litigation.

- **Built-in pager / scrollback viewer** — modern terminals (Windows Terminal, iTerm2, Wezterm, Konsole, Alacritty, Ghostty) all have native scrollback. Auto-run depends on the prompt being free immediately. **Hard rejected by the user.**
- **Thermal sensors** — opaque on macOS (`machdep.xcpm.cpu_thermal_level` is undocumented and Intel-only), fragile on Linux hwmon (thermal zone naming inconsistent across boards), gone from Windows in modern drivers.
- **Top processes by CPU/RAM** — blows up the compact 51-column table layout.
- **NIC link speed** — ethtool may not be installed on Linux; signal-to-noise is low for a one-line report.
- **Disk SMART data** — requires elevated privileges on most platforms; smartctl + nvme-cli are platform-fragile.
- **Package count** — unportable; nothing comparable across pacman/apt/dnf/brew/winget/snap/flatpak.
- **Serial number** — privacy-sensitive PII; if a user pastes a TR-300 report into Discord or GitHub they leak their AppleCare-claimable serial. Skip unless gated behind an explicit `--include-serial` flag.
- **Pending reboot indicator (Windows)** — low signal-to-noise for the default report; could land in a future `--security` flag if requested.
- **DPI scaling** — no resolution row currently exists to attach to.
- **LUKS root detection via lsblk parsing** — breaks on ZFS-encryption, fscrypt, stacked setups.
- **CPU temperature** — thermal zone naming inconsistent across boards.
- **Battery time-remaining ETA** — `power_now` lags 30s after AC change; misleading.
- **Last-boot reason** — distro-specific, needs root.

- [x] Tests: Windows unit + manual matrix (user-validatable)

### PR #4b — Deferred Windows accuracy (✅ shipped as v3.12.0, commit `28bda98`)

- [x] **C.4** VPN-aware default-route detection — `GetBestInterfaceEx` (manual extern, `iphlpapi`) + reorder existing WMI `Win32_NetworkAdapterConfiguration` rows by `interface_index` so the kernel-preferred adapter wins. *Plan deviation:* simpler than the originally-planned `GetBestInterfaceEx` + `GetAdaptersAddresses` linked-list walk; same VPN-aware outcome, ~50 LOC vs ~120 LOC, much smaller unsafe surface.
- [x] **C.5** Fast Startup uptime annotation — `detect_fast_startup()` reads `HiberbootEnabled` registry DWORD; `last_cold_boot_seconds()` queries `Win32_OperatingSystem.LastBootUpTime` via `wmi::WMIDateTime` (the wmi crate's serde-aware CIM datetime wrapper — an early hand-written parser was discarded). When divergence > 1h, render `9d 4h 12m (session: 7h 14m)`; full-mode-only.
- [x] **F.1–F.6** PR #4b documentation block — CHANGELOG, README, CLAUDE.md, Cargo.toml, auto-memory, TESTING.md.
- [x] Endianness fix in `sin_addr` (caught during Codex GPT-5.5 review): original `from_be_bytes` would have routed to wrong IP on non-palindromic destinations; fixed to `from_le_bytes` with explanatory comment.

### PR #5 — Windows polish (✅ shipped partially as v3.13.0, commit `f34e981`)

- [x] **C.8** GPU enumeration via DXGI `EnumAdapters1` — *plan deviation:* used the simpler registry-prefer + `filter_software_gpus()` name-based filter approach instead. ~25 LOC vs ~100 LOC of unsafe COM. Same user-visible outcome (no Microsoft Basic Render Driver). DXGI deferred unless a future bug demands vendor/device-ID filtering that name-based filtering can't do.
- [x] **C.9** Cores via `GetLogicalProcessorInformationEx` — two-call buffer-sizing pattern, alignment-safe walk via `u32::from_le_bytes` (caught in Codex review — the original raw-cast approach happened to work in practice but was technically UB per Rust spec). WMI fallback retained.
- [x] **C.10** Battery via `GetSystemPowerStatus` (deferred `DeviceIoControl` cycle-count enrichment).
- [x] **C.10b** *(plan addition, user-requested)* Extended C.10 from 3-state to 5+ states: `AC Power` (≥95% on AC, no charging — clean, no percentage), `X% (Charging)`, `X% (Plugged in)` (gaming-laptop PSU-undersized OR firmware battery-longevity), `X% (Discharging)` / `Critical` / `Low` overrides off AC, `X% (Unknown)` fallback. AC-status-unknown edge case renders bare `X%`.
- [x] **C.11** PowerShell 7+ detection via `PowerShellCore` registry. *Caught in Codex review:* original string-compare approach put `"7.9.0" > "7.10.0"`; fixed via `parse_semver_tuple` comparing `(u64, u64, u64)`.
- [x] **C.12** Terminal parent-process walk via Toolhelp32 — `CreateToolhelp32Snapshot` + `Process32FirstW`/`Process32NextW`, build `HashMap<pid, (parent_pid, name)>`, climb cap 10 levels. Recognizes Windows Terminal, WezTerm, Alacritty, VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Hyper, Tabby, Ghostty, Kitty, MinTTY, Claude Code, Antigravity. Intermediate hosts (`conhost.exe`, `powershell.exe`, `pwsh.exe`, `cmd.exe`, shells) skipped.
- [x] **C.13** Batched-PowerShell fallback into single JSON call — shipped in
  v3.14.0 (`get_batched_powershell_fallback()` plus parser fixtures). It is
  used only when the full-mode WMI connection fails, keeping the common path
  native/WMI-first and the `--fast` path COM-free.
- [x] **C.14** Drop COM/WMI init from `--fast` hot path — verified by audit: fast mode early-returns at `platform/windows.rs:66` BEFORE any `COMLibrary::new()` call; structurally already done.
- [ ] **E.6** Admin-only full RDP login history — **deferred to task #58**; needs elevated-shell validation. Implementation plan: `wevtutil qe Security /q:"*[System[EventID=4624]]" /c:50 /rd:true /f:xml`, hand-rolled XML parse, filter `LogonType ∈ {3,7,10,11}`, render 1-5 conditional rows under LAST LOGIN.
- [x] **F.1–F.6** PR #5 documentation block — CHANGELOG, README, CLAUDE.md, Cargo.toml, auto-memory, TESTING.md.
- [x] Tests: Windows polish unit (covered by existing test suite — additive changes don't need new tests; the deferred tests for `cpu.gpus` array regression and `session.login_history` are tied to the deferred E.6).

### PR #6 — Optional `--security` flag (⏸ deferred unless explicitly requested)

- [ ] Add `--security` CLI flag
- [ ] macOS: `fdesetup status`, `csrutil status`
- [ ] Linux: `/sys/class/tpm/tpm0/tpm_version_major`, `/sys/firmware/efi/efivars/SecureBoot-*`, `/sys/kernel/security/lsm`, `/sys/fs/selinux/enforce`
- [ ] Windows: `Win32_Tpm` via CIM (no admin), registry `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecureBoot\State\UEFISecureBootEnabled`
- [ ] Tests + docs

### Manual cross-platform matrix (in `TESTING.md`)

Tracks "Last verified" per row. Each PR appends a `### vX.Y.Z — YYYY-MM-DD` section under "Per-release verification log". Already populated for v3.10.0 and v3.11.0 (Windows 11 25H2 build 26200.8246, unelevated user session). Pending hardware: macOS Intel + Apple Silicon M1/M3/M4, Ubuntu 22.04, Debian 12, Fedora, Arch, Alpine in Docker, Raspberry Pi 4 aarch64, AWS EC2 (Graviton + Intel), WSL2, Win10 (no Fast Startup), Win11 ARM64, Win11 with admin shell.

## 4.7 Phasing & sequencing (the canonical PR order)

Land in this order. PR #1 unblocks every later PR. PR #4 already shipped, but C.4 + C.5 are deferred to PR #4b. Each PR is one commit (using the existing `release: vX.Y.Z - <summary>` convention).

| PR | Status | Commit | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | ✅ shipped | `58812cc` (v3.10.0) | Foundation: elevation tier scaffolding + CI + Codex config + workflow doc |
| 2 | ✅ shipped (v3.14.0) | `54dbae1` | macOS accuracy subset: CPU brand/frequency fallback, Rosetta arch label, scutil hostname/IP, AppleLocale precedence, P/E core split, model row, full-mode battery health, vm_stat fallback |
| 3 | ✅ shipped (v3.14.0) | `54dbae1` | Linux accuracy subset: systemd-resolved DNS, default-route source IP, locale precedence, power_supply battery iteration, terminal detection, WSL/container/VM detection, aarch64 CPU fallback, ZFS health, elevated dmidecode rows |
| 4 | ✅ shipped | `3a252df` (v3.11.0) | Windows accuracy (C.1, C.2, C.3, C.6, C.7) + BitLocker (E.5) + Windows PR docs |
| (4.5) | ✅ shipped | `22f2002` (v3.11.1) | Rust 1.95 MSRV + auto-rustup self-update + uzers RUSTSEC migration |
| 4b | ✅ shipped | `28bda98` (v3.12.0) | Deferred Windows accuracy: VPN-aware default-route (C.4 simplified design) + Fast Startup uptime annotation (C.5) |
| 5 | ✅ shipped (partial) | `f34e981` (v3.13.0) + `54dbae1` (v3.14.0) | Windows polish: native battery+5-state model (C.10/C.10b), native cores (C.9), GPU registry-prefer + name filter (C.8), PSCore detection (C.11), terminal parent walk (C.12), `--fast` COM-free verified (C.14), batched PowerShell WMI-failure fallback (C.13). Task #58 tracks E.6 admin RDP history. |
| 5b | ⏳ pending (task #58) | — | E.6 admin RDP login history only; requires elevated Windows validation |
| 6 | ⏸ optional | — | `--security` flag with TPM + Secure Boot + FileVault + SELinux/AppArmor |
| (cross-cutting) | ⏳ pending (task #56) | — | Battery 3-state model for Linux + macOS (mirror v3.13.0 Windows C.10b) |
| (infra) | ✅ shipped (task #54) | (v3.13.1) | release.yml MSRV/runner-image mismatch: added `rust-toolchain.toml` pinning `channel = "1.95"` so rustup auto-installs the right toolchain on every GitHub-hosted runner before `dist build` invokes cargo. Resolves `error: rustc 1.94.1 is not supported by ... tr-300 requires rustc 1.95` on Windows + Linux gnu + Linux ARM gnu runners. Single source of truth between `Cargo.toml` `rust-version` and the rust-toolchain pin. |

Within each PR, sub-tasks can be tackled in any order that compiles. Per-PR documentation block (F.1–F.6) runs at the end before commit. Verification runs before the push.

## 4.8 Codex plugin config (committed at project scope)

The repo includes `.claude/settings.json` so any session that clones the repo gets the same Codex review subagent without manual setup:

```json
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "openai-codex": {
      "source": {
        "source": "github",
        "repo": "openai/codex-plugin-cc"
      }
    }
  },
  "enabledPlugins": {
    "codex@openai-codex": true
  }
}
```

`.claude/settings.local.json` (per-machine state like `outputStyle`) is gitignored.

When a teammate or future-you on a fresh machine first opens the folder, Claude Code will prompt to trust the marketplace — accept it. Then the `codex:codex-rescue` subagent is available via the Agent tool (not via `/codex:rescue` slash command nor `Skill(codex:rescue)` — those don't work; only `Agent(subagent_type: "codex:codex-rescue")` does).

**Codex review timing**: dispatch *after* the PR exists on GitHub (Codex's `gh pr diff` path needs a real PR number). On `master`-direct workflows like this repo, dispatch Codex pre-push against the local diff if needed, and accept its review before tagging the release.

## 4.9 JSON schema versioning policy

`report::SCHEMA_VERSION` is currently `1`. Bump rules:

- **Bump on breaking changes**: rename, remove, or change-type any existing key.
- **Do NOT bump on additive changes**: new nullable keys such as `os.machine_model`, `cpu.core_topology`, `memory.ram_slots`, and `system.{motherboard,bios}` do not bump the schema version.

Top-level keys in the JSON output:

- `schema_version: u32` — added in v3.10.0 (currently 1)
- `elevated: bool` — added in v3.10.0
- `elevation_unlocks_more: bool` — added in v3.10.0; true only when platform has elevated-only data AND user is unelevated
- `os: { name, version, kernel, architecture }` — pre-existing
- `network: { hostname, machine_ip?, client_ip?, dns_servers[] }` — pre-existing
- `cpu: { processor, cores, sockets?, hypervisor?, frequency_ghz, load_1m?, load_5m?, load_15m?, gpus[] }` — pre-existing
- `disk: { used_bytes, total_bytes, percent }` — pre-existing
- `memory: { used_bytes, total_bytes, percent }` — pre-existing
- `session: { username, last_login?, uptime_seconds, shell?, terminal?, locale?, battery?, encryption? }` — `encryption` added in v3.11.0

Nullable fields (intentional `null` in JSON) per platform:

- `network.machine_ip` — null when offline
- `network.client_ip` — null when not on SSH (no `SSH_CLIENT` / `SSH_CONNECTION`)
- `cpu.sockets` — null in `--fast` mode (skipped)
- `cpu.hypervisor` — null in `--fast` mode unless platform sets it cheaply
- `cpu.load_1m` / `load_5m` / `load_15m` — null on Windows in `--fast` mode (the 200ms sleep is skipped)
- `session.last_login` — null in `--fast` mode on Windows; otherwise filled
- `session.shell` / `session.terminal` / `session.locale` / `session.battery` — null when unavailable on the platform or skipped in `--fast`
- `session.encryption` — null on macOS + Linux until A/B blocks land; null on Windows when query returns access-denied

## 5. The 7-phase development workflow (canonical — see CLAUDE.md § Development Workflow)

Every non-trivial change follows this cadence. Trivial fixes (typo, single-line patch) can skip phases 1–2 but **never** skip phase 5 (verification) or phase 6 (commit/push gates).

1. **Plan in plan mode.** Read-only, write to `~/.claude/plans/<name>.md`. Spawn parallel `Explore` agents for codebase reconnaissance and parallel `general-purpose` agents (`model: opus`) for authoritative web research (Apple docs, Microsoft Learn, kernel.org, systemd, freedesktop). Cite every source. End with `ExitPlanMode`.
2. **Task tracking upfront.** `TaskCreate` PR-level parents AND every sub-task verbatim from the plan. `TaskUpdate` to `in_progress` *before* starting and `completed` *immediately* on finish — never batched.
3. **Implement one PR at a time.** Read every file before editing. `cargo check` after each meaningful change. After each PR completes, run the full local gate.
4. **Per-PR documentation block (F.1–F.6).** CHANGELOG entry with task IDs in parens · README updates · CLAUDE.md arch notes with citations · Cargo.toml version bump · auto memory updates · TESTING.md verification log entry.
5. **Verification + Codex review.** Re-run the full local gate. For non-trivial PRs, dispatch `Agent({subagent_type: "codex:codex-rescue"})` for an independent review. **Codex's `gh pr diff` path needs the PR to actually exist** — open the PR first, then ask Codex to review.
6. **Commit + push gates.** Local commit → `git-master` agent (no ci-tester). Push to remote → `ci-tester` agent FIRST; if `[FAIL]`, fix root cause (no `--no-verify`); once `[PASS]`, hand off to `git-master` for the push. Tag a release → bump version in F.4, commit + push commits, **wait for CI to go green**, then `git tag vX.Y.Z && git push --tags`.
7. **Close out.** Mark the parent PR task `completed`. Move to next PR. Deferred PRs only run on explicit request.

---

## 6. Reproducing the local gate

```bash
cargo fmt -- --check
cargo clippy --all-targets --workspace -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace --all-targets
cargo build --release --workspace
./target/release/tr300 --version
./target/release/tr300 --fast --json | head -5
./target/release/tr300 --ascii          # visual smoke test
```

Plus on each platform:

```bash
# 5-run --fast median check (the speed gate)
for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do time ./target/release/tr300 --fast > /dev/null; done
```

CI runs the same checks across Linux, macOS ARM, and Windows. Intel macOS x86_64 was dropped from CI on 2026-04-28 because `macos-13` runner capacity has effectively retired (see `CLAUDE.md` § _Intel macOS coverage policy_); cargo-dist still builds the Intel binary at tag time. Local fmt/clippy/test only validates the host platform; cross-platform issues surface on remote CI runs.

---

## 7. Known limitations / honest notes

- **CPU FREQ on Intel Meteor Lake / Lunar Lake / Arrow Lake** (Core Ultra series): CPUID leaf 16h returns 0 because Intel zeroed it in microcode. `CallNtPowerInformation` reflects the active power-plan ceiling, which on these chips is honest about throttling. The user's machine (Core Ultra 7 155H) shows 1.4 GHz because the active power plan caps it at 1400 MHz — the report is correct, the machine is throttled.
- **Last login on local console sessions**: WTSConnectTime / WTSLogonTime return 0 for the local console session on most modern Windows installs (auto-login + Fast Startup mask the actual logon timestamp). The fallback derives the time from `GetTickCount64` (boot time), which is the meaningful answer for "since when have you been logged in".
- **Hyper-V detection on Win11 with VBS**: CPUID `Microsoft Hv` doesn't necessarily mean a VM — Win11 with Virtualization-Based Security runs the kernel on top of a thin Hyper-V layer. The code disambiguates via SMBIOS manufacturer (real Hyper-V VMs always have "Microsoft Corporation"; physical hosts have OEM strings), reporting `Bare Metal (Hyper-V/VBS)` for the latter.
- **BitLocker without admin**: query may return access-denied on older Win10 / domain-joined configurations. The code returns `None` gracefully and the elevation footer hint covers the gap. On Win11 Device Encryption laptops, the query usually succeeds non-admin.

## 7.5 Verification: when is a PR "done"?

A PR is done when ALL of these are true:

1. `cargo fmt -- --check` clean
2. `cargo clippy --all-targets --workspace -- -D warnings` clean
3. `cargo test --workspace` — every test passes (no `--ignore`d, no flaky)
4. `cargo build --release --workspace` produces a working binary on the host platform
5. `tr300 --version` reports the bumped version
6. `tr300 --fast --json | jq .` parses
7. `tr300 --ascii` visually correct
8. CI on GitHub Actions is green across all 3 matrix legs (Linux glibc, macOS ARM, Windows). Intel macOS coverage moved to tag-time-only via cargo-dist (see `CLAUDE.md` § _Intel macOS coverage policy_).
9. The `--fast` median wall-clock on the host platform did not regress > 100 ms vs the prior commit
10. `report --ascii` line count did not grow (verified in `tests/integration.rs`)
11. The user was able to confirm the changed field shows the right value on their actual machine for at least one of: macOS Apple Silicon, Win11, Linux

### Out-of-band research files (NOT committed; on the original Windows host only)

These are large research dumps from the planning phase. Useful as reference but not authoritative — the inline citations above are what matters.

- `~/.claude/plans/take-a-look-around-elegant-stonebraker.md` — full original plan with sections per platform, sub-task IDs, files to modify, testing strategy, phasing
- `~/.claude/plans/take-a-look-around-elegant-stonebraker-agent-a331823be3c6ba4a3.md` — Linux research dump
- `~/.claude/plans/take-a-look-around-elegant-stonebraker-agent-a93ada108401bdab8.md` — Windows research dump

If you need to reproduce the original research from scratch on a different machine, dispatch parallel `general-purpose` agents (model: `opus`) with WebFetch / WebSearch / Firecrawl / Perplexity access against per-platform briefs. The original briefs are in CLAUDE.md § Development Workflow phase 1 step 3.

## 8. Pickup instructions for a fresh session

1. `git pull origin master` to get the latest commits (`58812cc` and `3a252df` should both be present).
2. Read this file (`MASTER_PLAN.md`) end-to-end.
3. Read `CLAUDE.md` § "Development Workflow" and § "CI".
4. Run the local gate (Section 6 above) — confirm it's green on your machine.
5. Check `gh run list --workflow=ci.yml --limit=3` (or the Actions tab) — confirm CI on `3a252df` has gone green.
6. If not green, fix-forward (don't amend). If green and tags haven't been pushed: `git tag v3.10.0 58812cc && git tag v3.11.0 3a252df && git push --tags`.
7. Pick the next PR (Section 1 "Recommended next steps") and follow the 7-phase workflow (Section 5).
8. Update this file's Section 1 status snapshot when you ship a PR. Append to TESTING.md verification log too.

If you're on a Mac, prioritize PR #2. If you're on Linux, PR #3. If you're on Windows, PR #4b or PR #5.
