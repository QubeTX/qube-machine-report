# TR-300 Testing Guide

This file tracks the manual verification matrix that must pass before each tagged release, plus the automated gates that protect the auto-run UX.

## Automated gates (run by CI on every PR)

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs these on every push and pull request:

- **`fmt`** — `cargo fmt --check` (Linux)
- **`clippy`** — `cargo clippy --all-targets --workspace -- -D warnings` (Linux)
- **`test`** — `cargo test --workspace --all-targets` on Linux + macOS ARM + Windows
- **`build`** — release build smoke test on all three platforms (with a `--version` + `--fast --json` invocation to verify the binary runs)
- **`speed`** — 5-run median of `tr300 --fast` on Linux + macOS ARM + Windows, fails if median > 1500 ms (auto-run safety gate). Reports times in the job summary.
- **`audit`** — `cargo audit` against RustSec advisories (advisory-only; doesn't block)
- **`dist-plan`** — verifies cargo-dist config parses, so dist regressions don't surprise us at tag time

To reproduce locally before pushing:

```bash
cargo fmt -- --check
cargo clippy --all-targets --workspace -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace --all-targets
cargo run -- --json | jq .            # parses without error
cargo run -- --fast --json | jq .     # same, fast mode
cargo run -- --ascii                  # visual inspection
```

### Output stability gates

These protect the auto-run experience (open terminal → table renders → prompt is free immediately). A regression here breaks the core UX promise.

- **T.S.1 — Line count**: `report --ascii` must not grow in line count. New rows are only allowed when they're conditional (e.g. ZFS Health only renders when `zpool` exists; battery health enriches an existing row in place; encryption row only on Windows when readable).
- **T.S.2 — Speed**: `tr300 --fast` wall-clock must not regress more than 100 ms on any platform. Capture before/after numbers in the PR description.

## Manual cross-platform matrix

The "Last verified" column tracks which release confirmed each row. Update as part of each PR's documentation block (F-tasks).

## Per-release verification log

Append a section per tagged release noting which matrix rows were re-verified and on which hardware. Lets us catch silent regressions when a row stops being checked.

### v3.10.0 — 2026-04-27

Foundation scaffolding only — no collector changes. Verified:

- Windows 11 (build 26200): footer hint renders below table in full mode; absent in `--fast`; ANSI dim escapes when colors enabled. JSON contains `schema_version: 1`, `elevated: false`, `elevation_unlocks_more: true`. `--no-elevation-hint` suppresses the line cleanly.
- Library tests: 15 passed (8 pre-existing + 7 new for elevation footer logic and schema version).

Pending hardware verification (no collector changes that would affect them, but matrix entries should be stamped on next per-platform PR): macOS Intel/AS, all Linux distros, WSL2.

### v3.11.0 — 2026-04-27

Windows accuracy + BitLocker (PR #4). Verified on Windows 11 25H2 (build 26200.8246), unelevated user session:

- **OS row** — was `Windows 11 (26200)`, now `Windows 11 25H2`. Registry-based detection working.
- **Kernel row** — was `26200`, now `26200.8246` (full build with UBR).
- **Last-login row** — was `Login tracking unavailable`, now real timestamp `Tue Apr 21 22:12` (matches uptime). WTSLogonTime returned 0 (console session quirk); fell back to GetTickCount64-derived boot time as designed.
- **CPU freq row** — still `1.4 GHz` on this host (machine is power-plan throttled at 1400 MHz; CPUID leaf 16h returns 0 on Meteor Lake; CallNtPowerInformation correctly reports 1400 MaxMhz). Implementation correct; will show higher values on machines with full performance power plan or older Intel chips where leaf 16h works.
- **Hypervisor row** — was `Hypervisor Present`, now `Bare Metal (Hyper-V/VBS)`. CPUID returned `Microsoft Hv` correctly; SMBIOS manufacturer disambiguated to "physical host with VBS active".
- **Encryption row** — absent on this user's unelevated session (Win32_EncryptableVolume returned access-denied as expected). Footer hint covers the gap. Will surface on Win11 Device Encryption laptops and admin sessions.
- **Architecture row** — `x86_64` (unchanged on x64 host running x64 binary; IsWow64Process2 implementation will activate on ARM64 hosts).
- **Footer hint** — still renders correctly with the BitLocker mention; on hosts where the encryption row appears non-admin, the hint is harmless extra info about RDP login history (also admin-gated per E.6, deferred to PR #5).
- Integration tests: 13 passed (1 new for JSON `encryption` key); library tests: 15 passed.

Pending verification (deferred or platform-locked):
- Windows 11 ARM64 host (C.2 IsWow64Process2 emulation annotation)
- Windows 11 with admin shell (BitLocker full method visible; E.6 RDP history would land in PR #5)
- Windows 11 with Device Encryption ON, unelevated (BitLocker row should appear)
- Windows 11 in a real Hyper-V VM (CPUID `Microsoft Hv` + Microsoft Corp manufacturer → `Hyper-V`, not `Bare Metal (Hyper-V/VBS)`)
- Windows running inside KVM / VMware / VirtualBox (CPUID-based hypervisor brand detection)

### v3.12.0 — 2026-04-28

Windows accuracy refinements (PR #4b). Verified on Windows 11 25H2 (build 26200.8246), unelevated user session:

- **MACHINE IP / DNS IP rows (C.4)** — `GetBestInterfaceEx`-driven adapter selection working. With no VPN active, `MACHINE IP` resolved to `10.1.0.85` (LAN adapter selected as default route by the kernel — correct). `DNS IP 1` resolved to `10.1.0.1` (LAN gateway DNS — correct). Falls through to legacy first-match order when `get_best_route_interface_index()` returns `None`. JSON output includes `network.machine_ip` and `network.dns_servers[]` populated by the same path.
- **UPTIME row (C.5)** — `detect_fast_startup()` correctly read `HiberbootEnabled = 1` from registry. `last_cold_boot_seconds()` parsed `Win32_OperatingSystem.LastBootUpTime` via `wmi::WMIDateTime` (early hand-written CIM datetime parser was discarded after testing — wmi crate's serde wrapper handles the format natively). On this session the cold-boot time and kernel session age aligned within 1 hour, so the parenthetical annotation correctly stayed dormant. The `(session: …)` annotation will activate on hosts where Shut Down + Boot used Fast Startup hibernation resume (annotation appears when divergence > 1h).
- **JSON `os.session_uptime_seconds` key** — present in every output, nullable per design. New integration test `test_json_includes_session_uptime_seconds_key` pins the contract.
- **`--fast` median timing** — unchanged from v3.11.x baseline (~308 ms). Phase B is full-mode-only; the C.5 WMI cold-boot query is gated on `mode == CollectMode::Full`.
- Integration tests: 14 passed (1 new for `os.session_uptime_seconds`); library tests: 15 passed.

Pending verification (deferred or platform-locked):
- Windows 11 with active VPN client (Tailscale, WireGuard, OpenVPN, Cisco AnyConnect): `MACHINE IP` should swap between LAN address and tunnel address as VPN toggles on/off
- Windows 11 host immediately after Shut Down + Boot (Fast Startup hibernation resume): `UPTIME` row should display `(session: …)` annotation with kernel-session age shorter than cold-boot age
- Windows 11 host immediately after Restart (cold boot, bypasses Fast Startup): annotation should NOT appear (sysinfo uptime ≈ WMI cold-boot time)
- Windows host with `IP Helper` service disabled: `GetBestInterfaceEx` should fail and the function should fall through to legacy first-match adapter ordering

### v3.13.0 — 2026-04-28

PR #5 partial — Windows polish. Verified on Windows 11 25H2 (build 26200.8246), unelevated user session, fully-charged Alienware laptop on AC:

- **BATTERY row (C.10 + C.10b)** — was `100% (Discharging (High))` (legacy WMI `Win32_Battery`'s confusing `BatteryStatus` mapping), now `AC Power` (clean: percentage at full charge is uninformative, just shows AC state). Native `GetSystemPowerStatus` call confirmed working — no COM round-trip overhead. The 5-state model also covers gaming-laptop "PSU undersized for peak GPU draw" → `X% (Plugged in)`, firmware-limited charging (ThinkPad battery longevity) → also `X% (Plugged in)`, and the historical off-AC `X% (Discharging)` / `(Critical)` / `(Low)` states.
- **CORES row (C.9)** — value unchanged (1 socket on this single-package CPU), but now via native `GetLogicalProcessorInformationEx` walking variable-length `SYSTEM_LOGICAL_PROCESSOR_INFORMATION_EX` records. ~10x faster than the WMI path it replaced.
- **GPU rows (C.8)** — three hardware adapters detected: Intel Arc Graphics, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Laptop GPU, Trigger 6 External Graphics. No "Microsoft Basic Render Driver" or other software adapters (registry-prefer path doesn't enumerate them; `filter_software_gpus` name-based filter is the second line of defense).
- **SHELL row (C.11)** — `bash` (we're in Git Bash). PSCore detection fell through correctly (no PowerShell 7+ installed on this host); legacy WinPS-5.x path works as before. The PSCore detection logic was unit-verified by inspecting the `reg query` output format.
- **TERMINAL row (C.12)** — was `Console`, now `Claude Code`. Parent-process walk via Toolhelp32 correctly traversed `tr300.exe → bash.exe → claude.exe` and matched the "Claude Code" label. Verified by manual `Get-Process` parent-walk in PowerShell which produced the same chain.
- **Elevation footer** — `Run as Administrator for BitLocker status and full login history` still renders correctly in v3.13.0 (feature shipped v3.10.0, no regression). Suppressed by `--no-elevation-hint` flag and never rendered in `--fast` mode.
- **JSON additive keys** — `cpu.gpus` and existing keys all present; no new top-level keys added in v3.13.0 (no schema bump per MASTER_PLAN §4.9).
- **`--fast` median timing** — 338 ms (sorted-7 middle: 0.332, 0.333, 0.337, 0.338, 0.339, 0.376, 0.394). +30 ms vs v3.11 baseline ~308 ms. Within 100 ms budget per MASTER_PLAN §5; well under 1500 ms CI gate. Slight regression attributed to additional winapi feature bindings linked into the binary; full-mode collectors are equal-or-faster (C.9 saves ~30 ms via native socket count, C.10 saves ~40 ms via native battery, neither on the fast path).
- Integration tests: 14 passed (no new tests in v3.13.0; the existing test suite covers the additive changes); library tests: 15 passed.

Pending verification (deferred to future sessions):
- Windows 11 host with PowerShell 7+ installed (`HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\PowerShellCore\InstalledVersions\<GUID>` populated): SHELL row should show `PowerShell 7.x.y` instead of falling back to legacy 5.x detection
- Windows 11 host launched directly from Windows Terminal (without env-var inheritance loss): `WT_SESSION` env var path should match before the parent walk runs; verifies the env-var fast path
- Windows 11 host launched from WezTerm / Alacritty / Cursor / Tabby / Hyper / Ghostty / Kitty: parent walk should match the respective terminal label
- Gaming laptop running an active GPU-heavy load that exceeds AC brick wattage: BATTERY row should show `X% (Plugged in)` with percentage decreasing over time (validates the C.10b heuristic for the supplementing-from-battery case)
- ThinkPad / ASUS with battery-longevity firmware mode capping charge at 60-80%: BATTERY row should also show `X% (Plugged in)` (the same heuristic catches both the "PSU undersized" and "firmware limit" cases since they're indistinguishable from a single-snapshot SYSTEM_POWER_STATUS)
- Windows host with admin shell: BATTERY / CORES / GPU rows unchanged (no admin-gated behavior in v3.13.0); E.6 RDP login history pending in task #58
